The current project is a recipe website that allows users to view recipes online. By completing this project, I will have demonstrated my skills in web development, particularly in the use of HTML to create a user-friendly web application. I am excited to work on this project and to showcase my web development skills through the creation of a functional and engaging recipe website.
