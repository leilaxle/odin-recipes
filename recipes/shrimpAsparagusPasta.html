<h2> Wondering how to make this? Here's how. </h2>

<ol>

<li> Boil water for pasta:
    <ul>
        <li>  Fill a large pot with water and salt it generously. </li>
        <li> Set it over high heat and bring to a boil.</li>
    
    </ul>
</li>

<li> Cook the pasta:
    <ul>
        <li> When the salted water is at a rolling boil, add the pasta.  </li>
        <li>  Cook the pasta according to the package instructions, until it is just 1 minute shy of al dente, very nearly cooked but slightly too firm in the center, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>  Drain the pasta in a colander, reserving 1 cup of pasta water to add to the shrimp and asparagus.</li> 
    </ul>
</li>

<li> Cook the shrimp and asparagus: 
</li>

<li> Finish the dish:
    <ul>
        <li>  Add the drained pasta to the pan with 1/2 cup of the reserved pasta water and the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter. </li>
        <li> Cook, stirring occasionally and using tongs to coat the pasta with all of the ingredients in the pan.  </li>
        <li> Stir, until the pasta is tender but still firm in the center, 1 to 2 minutes. </li> 
    </ul>
</li>

<li> Serve and enjoy!
