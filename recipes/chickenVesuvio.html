<h2> Ingredients </h2> 
<ul>
<li> 1 tablespoon olive oil </li>
<li> 4 skin-on bone-in chicken thighs, excess fat and skin trimmed (about 1 3/4 pounds)</li>
<li> 2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided  </li>
<li> 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more for seasoning the potatoes </li>
<li> 2 large russet potatoes, skin on, cut into 1/2-to-3/4-inch wedges  </li>
<li> 1 tablespoon unsalted butter </li>
<li> Cloves from 1 head garlic, peeled and thinly sliced </li>
<li> 1 teaspoon dried oregano or Italian seasoning </li>
<li> 3/4 cup dry white wine </li>
<li> 3/4 cup frozen peas (not defrosted) </li>
<li> 1 tablespoon olive oil </li>
<li> Finely grated zest of 1 lemon (about 1/2 teaspoon)  </li>
<li> 1 tablespoon lemon juice </li>
<li> About 1/4 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves </li>
</ul>

<h2> Wondering how to make it? Here's how. </h2> 
<ol>
<li> Put the oven rack in the middle and preheat the oven to 400°F. </li>
<li> Season the chicken:
    <ul> 
        <li> Sprinkle the chicken with 1 1/2 teaspoons of the salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. </li>
    </ul>

</li>
<li> Cook the chicken: 
<ul>
<li> Heat a 12-inch cast-iron pan gradually over medium-low heat until it’s good and hot, about 10 minutes. </li>
<li> (This may seem like a long time, but the pan is over medium-low during this time, and the payoff is nice and crispy golden-brown skin.) </li> 
<li> Then turn the heat up to medium-high and add the oil. </li>
<li> Place the chicken in the pan, skin-side down. </li>
 <li> Cook without moving until the skin develops a nice brown crust, 8-10 minutes. </li>
<li> Remove to a plate. The chicken isn’t cooked through yet, so don’t worry. It goes in the oven with the potatoes later on.</li>
</ul>
</li>


<li> Cook the potato wedges: 
    <ul> 
        <li> Add the potato wedges and sprinkle with remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and a pinch of pepper. </li> 
        <li> Stir to coat with and arrange in the skillet flat side down. Cook until they turn light to golden brown. </li>
    </ul>
</li>

<li> Make the sauce:
    <ul>
        <li> Turn the heat to medium-low and add the butter, garlic, and dried oregano or Italian seasoning. </li>
        <li> Stir the sauce until the garlic is fragrant but doesn’t turn brown, about 30 seconds. </li>
    <li> Add the wine and frozen peas and bring to a simmer, about 20 seconds. </li>
    </ul>
</li>

<li> Add potatoes and chicken into the sauce:
    <ul>
<li> Turn off the heat, return the potatoes to the pan, and turn to coat in the sauce.  </li> 
<li> Then arrange the chicken on top, skin-side up, and drizzle any juices left behind on the plate around the potatoes.</li> 

    </ul>
</li>


<li> Bake the chicken and potatoes:
    <ul>
        <li> Place the pan in the oven and bake until the potatoes and chicken are cooked through. </li>
        <li> Chicken should have an internal temperature of 180 to 185°F. </li>
         <li> Do this for 30-35 minutes, depending on the size of the thighs.  </li>  
         <li>The chicken will deepen in color and the potatoes will be tender. </li>  
    </ul>
    <li> Finish and serve! </li> 

</li>
