<img src="../images/lemonPepper.jpg" width="400" height="500">

<h2> Ingredients </h2> 

<ul> 
<li> 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 2 large chicken breasts)</li>
<li>1 1/2 tablespoons lemon pepper seasoning, divided</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>
<li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
<li>1 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
<li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided</li>
<li>2 cloves garlic, minced or grated</li>
<li>1/2 cup chicken stock</li>
<li>1/3 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice (from 2 lemons)</li>
<li>1/4 cup Italian parsley, chopped</li>
<li> Lemon slices, for garnish (optional)</li>
</ul>

<h2> Wondering how to make this? Here's how. </h2>

<ol>

    <li> Cut the chicken breast into cutlets: 
       <ul>
<li> Place the palm of your hand flat against the top of a whole chicken breast to keep it from sliding around.  </li>
<li> With the broad side of your knife horizontal to the cutting board, cut through the chicken breast to create 2 thinner halves (cutlets).</li>
       </ul>
    </li>

    <li> Season, then dredge the chicken breasts: 
        <ul>
 <li> In a small bowl, combine 4 teaspoons of the lemon pepper seasoning and the salt.  </li>
 <li> Add the flour to a separate shallow dish. </li>
 <li> Season both sides of each of the chicken breasts with the spice mixture.  </li>
 <li> Dredge both sides of the seasoned chicken in the flour, shaking off any excess flour, then lay the dredged chicken on a wire rack or platter while you heat the pan.</li> 
        </ul>
     </li>

     <li> Pan-fry the chicken:
        <ul>
 <li> In a large skillet, heat the oil and 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium heat. </li>
 <li> Once the butter is melted, swirl the pan a little to combine the two fats. </li>
 <li> Once the oil in the skillet begins to shimmer, lay your chicken cutlets in a single layer in the pan. You may need to fry in batches.</li>
        </ul>
     </li>

     <li> Make the lemon pepper sauce:  
        <ul>
 <li> Melt the butter in the pan over medium heat. Once the butter has melted, add the garlic. </li>
 <li> Saut√© the garlic in the butter until fragrant, 30 to 45 seconds.</li>
 <li> Add the chicken stock and lemon juice and deglaze the pan, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. </li>
 <li> Allow the liquid in the skillet to come to a boil and continue to boil until very slightly thickened, about 1 minute.</li>
        </ul>
     </li>

     <li> Coat the chicken: 
        <ul>
 <li> Once the sauce has reduced slightly, return the chicken breasts to the pan.  </li>
 <li> Turn them over to coat both sides in the sauce and turn the stove off. </li>
 <li> Allow the residual heat from the pan to warm the chicken up before sprinkling the chopped parsley over top. </li>
        </ul>
     </li>

     <li> Garnish with lemon and serve!</li>
